# High-Level Overview:
**Distributed Transactions Overview**

Distributed transactions are a set of operations that span multiple technologies, such as databases and message queues, to ensure consistency and reliability across different systems. These transactions are crucial in maintaining data integrity and ensuring that all operations are executed as a whole or rolled back if any part fails.

**Key Concepts and Definitions:**

1. **Atomicity**: Ensures that all operations within a transaction are executed as a single unit, either completing successfully or failing entirely without partial changes[1].
2. **Consistency**: Maintains the integrity of the database by adhering to predefined rules before and after a transaction[1].
3. **Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC)**: Coordinates distributed transactions across multiple compatible participants using a two-phase commit protocol[2].
4. **Two-Phase Commit Protocol**: A protocol that ensures all participants in a distributed transaction agree to commit or roll back changes[2][5].

**Current State of the Field:**

- **Traditional Systems**: On-premises services like MSMQ and Microsoft SQL Server support DTC transactions, ensuring atomic consistency across resources[2][5].
- **Cloud Services**: Managed cloud services do not support DTC transactions, requiring alternative strategies such as the outbox pattern or stateful workflows to achieve consistency[2][5].
- **Challenges**: Distributed transactions face challenges in achieving consistency across different systems, particularly in cloud environments where traditional DTC mechanisms are not supported.
- **Solutions**: New technologies and patterns, such as the outbox pattern and stateful workflows, are being developed to address these challenges and ensure consistency in distributed systems[2][5].

In summary, distributed transactions are critical for maintaining data integrity across multiple systems. While traditional systems support DTC transactions, cloud services require alternative strategies to achieve consistency. The field continues to evolve with new technologies and patterns emerging to address these challenges.
